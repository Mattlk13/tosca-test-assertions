  This template will fail validation, because the FemaleParticipant
  node type refines the "person" property with a type that is derived
  from version 2 of the "Person" type, while the original Participant
  node type used Version 1 of the "Person" type. Better support for
  versioning profiles is required to avoid this problem.
