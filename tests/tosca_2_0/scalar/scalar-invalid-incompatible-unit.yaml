  Test case for the built-in 'scalar' type. This test fails because
  the value of a scalar property is incompatible with its units.
data_types:
  Bitrate:
    derived_from: scalar
    data_type: integer
    units:
      bits/s: 1 # This is the mandatory entry with multiplier one
      kbits/s: 1000 # No prefix defined so unit includes the prefix 'k' and the base unit 'bits/s'
      Kibits/s: 1024
      Mbits/s: 1000000
      Mibits/s: 1048576
      Gbits/s: 1000000000
      Gibits/s: 1073741824
