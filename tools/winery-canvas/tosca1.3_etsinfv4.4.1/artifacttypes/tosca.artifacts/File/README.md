## File Artifact

### Scope
This type belongs to YAML type definitions derived from OASIS TOSCA normative and non normative types v.1.3.

More information can be found in the [OASIS Open TOSCA Community Contribution Page](https://github.com/oasis-open/tosca-community-contributions/tree/master/profiles/org.oasis-open).

### Description
