## Root Node

### Scope
This type belongs to YAML type definitions derived from OASIS TOSCA normative and non normative types v.1.3.

More information can be found in the [OASIS Open TOSCA Community Contribution Page](https://github.com/oasis-open/tosca-community-contributions/tree/master/profiles/org.oasis-open).

### Description
This is the default (root) TOSCA Node Type that all other TOSCA nodes should extends.  This allows all TOSCA nodes to have a consistent set of features for modeling and management (e.g, consistent definitions for requirements, capabilities, and lifecycle interfaces).
